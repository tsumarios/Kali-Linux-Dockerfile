# Kali-Linux-Dockerfile

A simple dockerfile which allows you to build a _docker image_ starting from the latest official one of **Kali Linux** and including some useful tools.

## Included tools

These are the main **tools** which are included:

- Kali Linux [Top 10](https://tools.kali.org/kali-metapackages) metapackage
- exploitdb
- man-db
- dirb
- nikto

Note that you can _add/modify/delete_ configuration files by doing the related changes in the dockerfile.

### Other useful things

Also [zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) is installed as default shell. You can add some changes directly in the [.zshrc](https://github.com/zMrSec/Kali-Linux-Dockerfile/blob/master/config/.zshrc) file, such as setting your favourite theme.
_Python-Pip_ and _NodeJS-NPM_ are included, too.

### Usage

In order to build an _image_ from this dockerfile, just go on the folder where it is located and simple open your favourite **Terminal**, typing as follows:

```sh
